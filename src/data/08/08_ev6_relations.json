    "title": "Gatsby recounts his experiences in the war and his attempts to return home, but he was sent to Oxford instead. He recalls Daisy's letters expressing her worries and need for reassurance. Daisy's life was filled with social events and superficiality, while she longed for a decisive force to shape her life. Tom Buchanan's arrival provided that force, leading to Daisy's decision to marry him, which Gatsby learned about while still at Oxford. ",

    "text": "\nshe turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She\nhad caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and\nmystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many\nclothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the\nhot struggles of the poor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she\ndidn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way off\nmy ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden\nI didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have\na better time telling her what I was going to do?”\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his\narms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the\nroom and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his\narm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon\nhad made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them",
