The Carraways are something of a\nclan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of\nBuccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s\nbrother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil\nWar, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father\ncarries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nfather’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of\na century after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,\n“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm\nseason, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly\ntrees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a\nhouse together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He\nfound the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a\nmonth, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and\nI went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a\nfew days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who\nmade my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to\nherself over the electric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more\nrecently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him.
