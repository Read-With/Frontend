    "text": "It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.\n\n“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”\n\n“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\n\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n\n“Carraway.”\n\n“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”\n\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n“Going away?” I inquired.\n\n“No, old sport.”\n\n“I hear you fired all your servants.”\n\n“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.\n\n“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.",

As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocketbook slapped to the floor.\n\n“Oh, my!” she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.\n\n“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! … Hot! … Hot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?”\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!\n\n… Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.\n\n“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this noon!”\n\nWhat he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see.”\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.\n\n“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n“We can’t move,” they said together.\n\nJordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.\n\n“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.”\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligations to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”\n\n“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.\n\n“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”",

Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.\n\n“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.\n\n“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.\n\n“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”\n\n“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”\n\n“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”\n\n“Where’s Daddy?”\n\n“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”",

The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.\n\n“Come, Pammy.”\n\n“Goodbye, sweetheart!”\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\n\n“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.\n\n“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n\n“I’m right across from you.”\n\n“So you are.”\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”",

Let’s all go to town!”\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.\n\n“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”\n\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.\n\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man—”\n\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.\n\n“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.\n\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\n\nHe didn’t answer.\n\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”",

He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays.”\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.\n\n“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”\n\nHe opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand.

His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitously from his control.
